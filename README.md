# New photoshoot signup system for Desucon & co.

The aim of this application is to enable cosplayers and photographers find each other in a convention and facilitate arranging cosplay photoshoots.

## Getting started

### Docker Compose

    docker-compose up

In another terminal:

    docker-compose exec web python manage.py import_event frostbite2017
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py make_dummy_photographers 3
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py make_dummy_cosplayers 5

    open http://localhost:8000

### Traditional way

    python3 -m venv venv3-shoottikala
    source venv3-shoottikala/bin/activate
    git clone git@github.com:conikuvat/shoottikala
    cd shoottikala
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    export DEBUG=1

    python manage.py setup
    python manage.py import_event frostbite2017
    python manage.py make_dummy_photographers 3
    python manage.py make_dummy_cosplayers 5

    python manage.py runserver
    open http://localhost:8000

The `setup` script created a superuser `mahti` with password `mahti`. Use [/admin/login/](http://localhost:8000/admin/login/) instead of the login link to log in.
